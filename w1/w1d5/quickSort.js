    Create a function that uses yesterdayâ€™s partition to fully sort an array
    in-place.

    Unstable sort.
    
    Time Complexity
        - Best: O(n log(n)) linearithmic.
        - Average: O(n log(n)) linearithmic.
        - Worst: O(n^2) quadratic.
    
    Space: O(1) constant.

    Params: nums, left, right
    - left and right are indexes, for now, left will be 0, and right will be the
        last idx.
    - later these params will be used to specify a sub section of the array to
        partition.
        
        Steps:
        This is a Divide and Conquer algorithm.
        You pick an element as pivot then partition the array around the pivot you picked.
        There are many different ways to pick the pivot.
        Just pick first element as pivot.
        it first divides a large array into two smaller subarrays and then recursively sort the subarrays.
        
        Basically, three steps are involved in the whole process:

        Pivot selection: Pick an element, called a pivot, from the array leftmost or rightmost.
        Partitioning: Reorder the array such that all elements with values less than the pivot come before the pivot. In contrast, all elements with values greater than the pivot come after it. The equal values can go either way. After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final position.
        Recur: Recursively apply the above steps to the subarray of elements with smaller values than the pivot and separately to the subarray of elements with greater values than the pivot.
